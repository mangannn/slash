### Scattered

Early stages of an adventure/slash game.

Made by:

This is programmed in C++ and uses only SFML (www.sfml-dev.org/) as library. It should work cross-platform, although development is done on Linux and compling might be a hassle on other platforms.

It includes an editor for making maps.
